<h2>Summary</h2>

We developed a system that displays the current and historical capacity of computers at the public labs at Ben-Gurion University.

The system's requirements were characterized by Mr. Luber, head of Personal Computation Section department. This system provides a solution to all the client's demands and needs. Also, it is easy to use, and well designed. The system collects the university's computer usage data and will be used by the IT administrators, and those who holds management position at the university. Also, the system will use them to attain a deeper understanding about the use of computers and support the decision making, regarding the logistics of computers in the labs (adding or removing computers or classroom, etc.).

The system was implemented by advanced technologies. The software's interfaces are internet based; the user can watch the computer's capacity in real time, so as managing the computer classroom easily, and extract from it useful reports that analyze the activity of university computers.

During the work on this project, we used tools that we acquired during our studies such as: System characterization, requirements settings, system analyzing and designing, internet environment developing, data security and communication, databases, project management and so on.

The system was assimilated at the university network, in a setting that simulate the network structure, while waiting for approval to be implanted in the production environment.

The system has several limitations: a. It can be access only in the university domain. B. It provides service only in the Hebrew language. C. It is not adapted to smartphones.

During the work on this project, there were several challenges that arose. Examples for some of them are concerning with permissions, foreseeing all possible scenarios and outcomes, teamwork, time management and designing the system.

Surely, the execution of this project was very beneficial to us, in the sense that it provided us with integration of all the knowledge and skills we acquired during our studies, and the opportunity to implement it in real life.
